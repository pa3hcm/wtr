# wtr

**wtr** will be a simple command line client for the Rijkswaterstaat Waterinfo API, allowing users to query dutch water measurements in a convenient way.

The API as described [here](https://rijkswaterstaatdata.nl/waterdata/).

Please note that this is still work-in-progress, it still lacks lots of functionality
